3D Virtual Guitar Simulator
A web-based 3D guitar simulator built with Three.js and Tailwind CSS, allowing users to interact with a virtual guitar fretboard, mark and strum notes, play chords, and record sessions. The app features intuitive note visualization, a chord picker, and a responsive interface, making it ideal for guitar enthusiasts and learners.
Features

3D Fretboard Visualization: Interactive 3D guitar fretboard with note labels (e.g., "E", "G#") displayed as sprites, focusing on neck, strings, and tuning pegs.
Note and Chord Marking: Click to mark notes (red dots) on 3D/2D fretboards, supporting open (fret 0) and closed (fret > 0) notes. Chord positions are highlighted (green dots).
Strum and Play:
Strum: Play the current chord or manually set frets with the "Strum" button or Space key.
Strum Marked Notes: Play only marked notes in sequence, respecting open/closed states.
Roll-Over Strum: Hover over 3D strings in Fretboard Mode to strum individual notes.


Chord Picker: Dropdown to select and visualize chords on both 3D and 2D fretboards.
Fretboard Popup: Displays string, fret, and note (e.g., "String 1, Fret 3, G#") on hover in Fretboard Mode.
Lock/Recall Chords: Save custom fretboard states as chords and recall them via a dropdown.
Record and Playback: Record notes/chords and save them as playable recordings.
Save/Load: Export/import chords, locked chords, recordings, and marked notes as JSON.
Chord Editor: Rename, delete, or reorder chords via a drag-and-drop popup.
Piano Keys: Play simple piano notes for reference.
Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile with a clean, non-overlapping UI.
Accessibility: ARIA labels and Tab navigation for keyboard accessibility.
Error Handling: Robust try-catch blocks and alerts for user feedback.
